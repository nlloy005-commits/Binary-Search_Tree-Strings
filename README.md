# Binary-Search_Tree-Strings

A C++ Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation for strings with duplicate counting, memory management, and standard tree operations.

## Features

Insert, search, and remove strings while handling duplicates.

Tree traversal: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

Find smallest and largest strings in the tree.

Compute height of nodes and the tree.

Proper memory management using destructors.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

C++ programming and object-oriented design

Recursive algorithms for tree operations

Dynamic memory management and pointers

Data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST)

Console input/output

## Learning Outcomes

Understand Binary Search Tree operations: insertion, search, deletion.

Practice recursive algorithms for tree manipulation.

Learn memory management with dynamic allocation and destructors.
